2. Move around and inspect directories.
3. Project structure.
4. Create a script and run it.

### Understand the structure to the command:

A command can work on it's own.
command

it can use extra (short) parameters
command -l -p -t

It can use longer parameters, sometimes a parameter has a long or a short version
command --parameter --dothething

It may require extra information for some parameters
command --parameter1 123 --parameter2 abc

An argument is that extra bit which is not a parameter

command -p -q -r1 -parameter 123 argument_1 argument_2
