# Transcriptomics Workshop

Three lessons with bare bones know-hows to get started.
This is not an extensive workshop.
This is not a course.
This is an introductory hands on workshop for people working in [CEFE](https://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/fr/)

This is an introduction trying to promote good practices for bioinformatics.
I hope you'll enjoy it.
