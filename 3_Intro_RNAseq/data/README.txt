Data README.txt

For this exercise the data will not be included.
You'll have to make your own symbolic links to get things up and running.

The list_of_files.txt will help you get a sample of files to work with.

raw_data/batch_1
    It contains a DELETEME.txt that should not be there. it is necessary for the directory to remain there.
    This is just a small sample of the data to be trated.
    Always start small and after you adjusted the parameters with this batch. Remember to remove all intermediate data.
    It's easier to re-create the data than to delete it later on in your project.
