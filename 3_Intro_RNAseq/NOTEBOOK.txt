## DATA

Data is re-downloading from the site of the provider.
Some samples have been re-sequenced. An update of data is on course

I started a "Best Practices" on this project to keep things tidy.

Quality Check of data will not fully start until the data has been properly downloaded.

Some files will be used for the workshop "Introduction to Transcriptomics": https://github.com/3nrique0/transcriptomics_workshop
Specially the 3rd part



## SCRIPTS
Some gathered from the previous lesson, some build in for this occasion.
