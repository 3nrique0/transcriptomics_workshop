# Introduction to Bioinformatics

We'll try to understand a project that is ongoing, **project_A**.
As we explore the different sections of the file we'll make use of the structure of a project we learned how to create on the previous workshop.

This file, **README.md** will serve as an index.


## Check the README.txt

**_ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS_** start by checking the README.txt file.
Maybe the information contained is trivial, but in a few months it may be helpful.
If it is not helpful, you can modify it :-)


Is there a NOTEBOOK.txt file ? What is the advancement of the project ?
Can we go check out what has been done and how it works ?



This is session 2 of the introduction to Transcriptomics
