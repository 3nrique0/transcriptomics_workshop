# Introduction to Bioinformatics

We'll try to understand a project that is ongoing, **project_A**.
As we explore the different sections of the file we'll make use of the structure of a project we learned how to create on the previous workshop.

This file, **README.md** will serve as an index.


## History of bioinformatics

The term [_bioinformatics_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics) was first mentionned by Paulien Hogeweg and Ben Hesper in 1970 to refere to the study of information processes in biotic systems. It was a term similar to _biochemistry_ used to name the field of study of chemical processes in biological systems. 

Between the years 1970's to the late 1990's this term was used to encompass domains like Evolutionary Biology, Phylogeny and Popilation Genetics. Since the advent of the Human Genome Project and pyrosequencing in the early 2000's the term _Bioinformatics_ was extended to the study of genomics.

Bioinformatics by it's roots means _BIOlogical INFOrmation autoMATIzation_. It allows to apply particularly _text mining_ methods to analyse full sets of (gen)omic information.

## Check the README.txt

**_ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS_** start by checking the README.txt file.
Maybe the information contained is trivial, but in a few months it may be helpful.
If it is not helpful, you can modify it :-)


Is there a NOTEBOOK.txt file ? What is the advancement of the project ?
Can we go check out what has been done and how it works ?



This is session 2 of the introduction to Transcriptomics
