The NOTEBOOK.txt is used as a lab book..ish

The results and other things will not be posted here, neither the code.
This will only serve as a reference to the state of advacement of the project.

IDEALLY
There are several batches of data, So we can treat them separately.

So far: 
-Series_1 is 1 pair of reads
    fastqc has worked on it
    creating local virutalenv to use multiqc was a failure
    multiqc has ran on admin's ~/envs/biopython

Is there a difference in the mapping if data is cleaned or not cleaned ? -- This will be the objective of today's workshop
