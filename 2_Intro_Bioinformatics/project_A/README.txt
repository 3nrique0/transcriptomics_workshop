This is a project concerning NGS sequencing.

The first steps to any NGS project are the same.
This is a dummy project with no other "guide line" than making you see and try different things you could find in an ongoing project.

NGS DATA are just chunkgs from different sources.

For the purpose of this project DATA will not have a precise origin.

Some information is already present on the internet.
In which case the link to the original source will be provided.

Enjoy !!

--> Go see the NOTEBOOK.txt inspect it and figure where to go after that
