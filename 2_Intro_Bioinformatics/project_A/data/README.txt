This is the data README.txt

This is where you keep track of
- When data was downloaded
- Versions of genome used
- Links to where data is available (if it's public)
- When was data produced
- md5sum from some files ? which ones !

You don't need to be extensive but it needs to be understandable.


raw_data
    series_1 

        Contains 1 pair of reads straight from sequencer


    series_2 -- Send it to project_B
        ? Contains an example of bad quality weird data
        ? more data and let people analyse this one


    series_3
